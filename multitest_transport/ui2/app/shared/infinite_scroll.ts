/**
 * Directive for implementing an infinite scroll UI.
 *
 * The InfiniteScroll directive is agnostic of what the underlying component or
 * element is; it only needs to be attached to a scrollable element. The
 * scrollable component must handle the `scrollLoad` event and replace its
 * `completed` promise with one that resolves when the loading is completed.
 *
 * The scrolling threshold is based on a percentage of the container height, and
 * not a precise pixel height, because the size of content may not be known in
 * advance, and this approach scales to different container heights without
 * requiring advance calculations of offsets. Using the container height instead
 * of content height also provides consistent behavior in terms of how much
 * content remains to be scrolled before triggering a new load, e.g. it will not
 * change based on how much content is already loaded/scrolled past.

   * percentage of the total container height, which the scrolled distance must
   * exceed in order to trigger a new load.
   *
   * For example, given these values:
   * - Threshold (%): 75
   * - Container height: 200px
   * - Content height: 1000px
   *
   * Threshold * container height yields 150px. Subtracting from the end of the
   * content, we get 1000px - 150px = 850px. The next load will be triggered
   * when the BOTTOM of the scroll position is >= 850px, which corresponds to
   * a `scrollTop` of 850px - 200px = 650px.
   *
   * The actual threshold is always based on the container height, not the
   * content height or an arbitrarily-chosen dimension. One way to think of this
   * is: in the example above, if we are displaying a table that is 1000px high,
   * and every row is exactly 50px, a content load will always be triggered just
   * after the third-to-last row starts scrolling into view.
