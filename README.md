# Android Test Station

**Android Test Station** is a testing tool that Android developers and test
engineers can use to employ a user interface for running standard Android tes
suites, such as the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

This tool acts as a web interface for Trade Federation (TF), allowing you to
easily run CTS on a set of test devices with minimal setup, as well as establish
a schedule to continuously run tests.
